                                                 NOTE 1 : introduction :

-Data Structure:
is a primitive data type hold a single piece of data.

-Data structures :
        are ways in which data is arranged
        in your computer's memory (or stored on disk).
     or:
        A systematic way of organizing and accessing data.

-Data structure discipline :
    concerned with the details of coding and data storage.

-Abstract Data Type [ADT]: 
        is a data type together with the operations, whose properties are 
        specified independently of any particular implementation.
        or:
            is a model/specification of a data type defined by :
                   #Its set of operations including inputs and outputs, 
                    #the specified behavior of those operations, and
                    #A model of the structural relationship
                         of the data contained by an instance of the ADT.

-ADT follow the principle of :
    (good design - abstraction - encapsulation - modularity).

-Encapsulation: 
    Providing data and operations on the data.

-Abstraction: 
    hiding the details.

Modularity: 
    Splitting a program into pieces.

-Linear Structure (array  - linked list - stack - queue - priority queue).
